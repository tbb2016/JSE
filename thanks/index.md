#### Here's what happens next ...

Based on your message, if at first blush it seems like a good mutual fit for us to do business together, we'd like to offer you <u>a free 50 minute phone consultation</u>.

<ol>
  <li>We are NOT going to "pitch" you. The way we engage is based on needs-focused, "consultative selling."</li>
  <li>We ARE going to be asking a lot of simple but poignant questions. And we're going to be listening even more. We want to understand your goals, your existing plans, and your challenges &amp; timelines. The quicker you can come up with this type of input for us, <mark>the faster we can help you</mark>.</li>
</ol>

Straight away we'd like to be able to provide you with some customized solutions — at no charge, and on our first call together.

<blockquote><p>So, if you want to <strong>add more detail</strong> to what you just sent, then go back and <u>submit the form again</u> — Here's why:</p></blockquote>

### The more you can tell us up front, the more prepared we'll be to ask smart questions and do some early advisement on crucial parts of your business.

That said, we are not the type of "advisors" or "consultants" who sit on the sidelines chatting in your ear and writing up TPS reports. No. We're doers. We take initiative. We want to proudly assume ownership of a crucial part of your business.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You could probably hire a new FTE or create an internal tiger-team … but instead we want <mark>you to decide to let Trendara design and run an essential part of your business</mark>; at least for the duration of our engagement together.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We are going to be personally responsible for making sure that a crucial job gets done for you. In other words, rather than a consultant, <u>we'll be acting as a manager</u> —  <strong>an expert manager who reports to you; a manager who does the hard work</strong> and takes on the hassles you'd rather not think about until the systems are in place and ready for your personal review and feedback.

<blockquote><p>Our credibility comes from our ability to solve problems, and our ability to deliver — not our ability to provide sage advice or "consulting" from some hilltop or silo.</p></blockquote>

  &hellip; I HOPE WE CAN show you that we are the type of people you would normally hire in to your company as full-time employees to contribute to your sales and marketing efforts.<BR><BR> 

  So yes, we want to get some solid information from you up front. So please go back and add some more detail to your form submission if you feel you need to.<BR><BR>

  I look forward to speaking with you on the phone!<BR><BR>

  Sincerely,<BR><BR>
